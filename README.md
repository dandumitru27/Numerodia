# Numerodia

A daily in-browser game developed with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

Guess the daily number in four tries, with helpful hints along the way.

It was online at numerodia.com and ro.numerodia.com. I've since let the domain expire, but I've deployed the English version to GitHub Pages at: https://dandumitru27.github.io/Numerodia/
